# Test Results

## Summary
✅ **All tests passed**: 13/13 tests passing across 2 test suites

## Test Coverage

### Singleton Behavior Tests (`lib.test.ts`)
- ✅ Returns a PHPRequestHandler instance
- ✅ Returns the same instance when called multiple times (singleton pattern)
- ✅ Only initializes Playground once
- ✅ Accepts blueprint object instead of path
- ✅ Makes simple requests to WordPress

### API Functionality Tests (`api.test.ts`)
- **Authentication**
  - ✅ Authenticates and gets JWT token
  - ✅ Fails with wrong credentials
  
- **User API**
  - ✅ Gets current user info with valid token
  - ✅ Fails without authentication token
  - ✅ Fails with invalid token
  
- **REST API Discovery**
  - ✅ Gets REST API index
  
- **Posts API**
  - ✅ Retrieves posts
  - ✅ Creates a post with authentication

## Performance
- Total test duration: ~21.66s
- Playground initialization: ~20s (happens only once due to singleton)

## Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests once (for CI)
npm run test:run

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## Notes
- Tests verify the singleton pattern is working correctly
- API tests confirm JWT authentication is functioning
- Custom user fields (last_login, joined, role, capabilities) are properly exposed
- Tests run in Node.js environment with 60-second timeout for Playground initialization
